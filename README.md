NC GEARS maintains this Robot Base each season to support many teams that need additional code support.
It may be freely copied and used. If you find it helpful, please send Jim an email saying thanks
or to share ideas for improvement.

## How to use this robot base
1. Make sure you have the latest WPI VSCode installed
2. Install git for windows (https://gitforwindows.org/)
3. Start VS Code
4. Click the "Source Control" sidebar item (left sidebar, looks like 3 little circles connected with lines)
5. Click "Clone Repository"
6. Enter the URL to this repo (https://github.com/ncgears/2023ChargedUp)
7. Choose a folder to store this code (Recommended: C:\FRC\)
8. Choose "Open" when asked if you would like to open the cloned repository
9. Click "Yes I trust the authors" when prompted
10. See the notes in src\main\java\frc\robot\Robot.java about setting team number, etc.

You may fork this repo (make a copy for yourself) and use it as you see fit.

## If I am helping your team, you will need to select the appropriate branch for your team.
1. After cloning the repo (How to use this robot base, above), in the bottom left of the VS Code, click "master"
2. In the pop-up dialog, start typing your team number. There should be a branch named "XXXX_TeamName" for you.
3. Select the branch related to your name.

## When you are ready to take your code and go out on your own repo
First off, congratulations!  I am happy you are ready to give it a go.  You have a few options:
1. Fork the entire repository (this will clone everything, including the branches for other teams)
2. Create a new repo of your own, copy the contents of the folder to your new repo and init the repo
3. Write from scratch anything you want to keep

I am always happy to have you make "ncgears" a collaborator on your own repository so that I can help you with code and push changes to you.
